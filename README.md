QA Technical Test
1. Quality Assurance is the overall process of defining how software quality can be achieved and how the development organisation knows that the software has the required level of quality.Quality Control is the definition and enactment of processes that ensure the software developement have followed project quality procedures and standards. Testing is identifying bug/error/deffect in a software. 
2. Software testing life cycle has the phases as follows:
  a.  Requirement Analysis  : Understands the requirement in terms of what we will testing & figure out the testable requirements
  b.  Test Planning         : Identify the activities and resources which would help to meet the testing objectives. Determine effort and                               cost estimates for the project and also determine Test Strategy.
  c.  Test Case Development : Creation, verification and rework of test cases & test scripts. Test data , is identified/created and is                                   reviewed and then reworked as well.
  d.  Environment Setup     : Decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is tested.
  e.  Test Execution        : Start executing test cases based on prepared test planning & prepared test cases in the prior step.
  f.  Test Cycle Closure    : Meet , discuss and analyze testing artifacts to identify strategies that have to be implemented in future, taking lessons from the current test cycle.
3. A format of writing a good test case should cover the following: Condition to tell what it is, Criteria to tell what should be, Effects to tell why the difference between what is and what should be is significant,and Cause to tell the reason for the deviation.
4. Perhaps I can reduce testing time variability by agile systems, which maximize flexibility and minimize variability with the purpose to identify the variability in the sotware testing process so that the variability in those steps/ tasks that would be included in an agile testing process is minimized.
5. Negative testing is a test which checks if the application behaves as expected with invalid data as input or unexpected user behavior.It is different from positive testing because positive testing checks if the application behaves as expected with valid data as input.
6. By doing test coverage, achieving the coverage objectives in the test plan to specific system components.
7. The different artifacts should be : Test Case ID, Test Case Name, Test Case Description, Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Application/Release Name, Pass/Fail
8. Regression tests are the tests which are done after the system/software is modified either to correct errors or to augment the original system.
9. No, I've never used it. Automation tools are tools that are capable of executing tests, reporting outcomes and comparing results with earlier test runs.
