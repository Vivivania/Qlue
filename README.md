1.

Testing is identifying bug/error/deffect in a software.

3. A format of writing a good test case should cover the following: Condition to tell what it is, Criteria to tell what should be, Effects to tell why the difference between what is and what should be is significant,and Cause to tell the reason for the deviation.
4. Perhaps I can reduce testing time variability by agile systems, which maximize flexibility and minimize variability with the purpose to identify the variability in the sotware testing process so that the variability in those steps/ tasks that would be included in an agile testing process is minimized.
5. Negative testing is a test which checks if the application behaves as expected with invalid data as input or unexpected user behavior.It is different from positive testing because positive testing checks if the application behaves as expected with valid data as input.
6. 
7. The different artifacts should be : Test Case ID, Test Case Name, Test Case Description, Steps, Expected Result, Actual Result, Application/Release Name, Pass/Fail
8. Regression tests are the tests which are done after the system/software is modified either to correct errors or to augment the original system.
9. No, I've never used it. Automation tools is
